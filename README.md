Notes, suggestions and helpful scripts that I often need during fresh installation

## Software installation

### Firefox Developer Edition
### 1Password
### Modifier Keys vs Karabiner
### Whatsapp
### IDEA Toolbox
### Warp || iTerm2
### Zap
### Postman || Obsidian
Replace Finder?

### brew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
- Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
```bash
    (echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> $HOME/.zprofile # TODO change to have .settings or whatever
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```
